With software like Blender and Unity3D around, as well as libraries like SharpGL, X3D as a markup for 3D scenes makes for a viable alternative to the COLLADA XML dialect and other formats.

X3D is underrated, undeveloped, and needs to have its roots revived!
Thus, the Author is proud to present this little C# X3D library for those in need.

A version of SharpGL ships along free of charge as the library uses it at the moment as a point of reference.

We're a bit low on documentation at this stage.
I have included a few X3D examples pulled from random sources on the www. 
As X3D is reasonably close semantically to the now deprecated VRML, you may look into the VRML books for help.
There is also plenty of books, online tutorials, and examples on OpenGL around so feel free to use them.
If you are a beginner in C# or the .NET framework, I'd recommend a mad surf on the www as a starter, and something from the Sams Teach Yourself series as an entrée.
Perhaps untertake a semester of a Computing course if you have difficulty.

If you observe the library is not yet complete. 
Although there are some minimal usable functionalities, 
i.e. a partial <Shape> rendering implementation; polygon, and colour-per-vertex parsing
the todo list can be itemised in the following:

* transformations
* colouring
* texturing
* lighting
* shading
* NURBS
* <Scene> parsing & rendering
* X3DB parsing
* expose rendering options in core library
* support for WebGL (is intended)
  - port the library to a technology like JSIL for WebGL and XMLHttpRequest support
