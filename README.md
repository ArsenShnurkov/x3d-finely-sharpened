Featuring the latest bleeding edge developmental work on the X3D C# language binding. 

Quick run through
* a pure C# engine implementation (no Unity)
* full core support
* shaders, scripting
* event model and propagation
* striving for ISO/IEC X3D v3.3 standard compliancy
* OpenGL 4.0

Intro
```

With software like Blender as well as products like InstantReality, 
X3D as a markup for 3D scenes makes for a viable alternative 
to the COLLADA XML dialect and other 3D formats and engines. 
In addition to the realtime rendering capabilities of a typical X3D engine, 
X3D serves as a good abstraction, an interchange, 
bundling all the concepts of a modern realtime engine 
into one package that is very programmer friendly. 

There is a future where all Mixed Reality applications 
will be based on a converged 3D standard. 
We believe this standard is X3D Extensible 3D Graphics 
furthering development of standardised Mixed Reality interfaces 
for the web, mobile, and desktop platforms. 
This engine is focusing on this space and will be multiplatform.

"X3D is used for building 3-dimensional models, both simple and sophisticated, 
X3D can show animated objects from different viewpoint perspectives, 
allowing user insight and interaction. 
X3D models can be further combined and connected to build sophisticated 3D virtual environments 
running across the Internet." (Brutzman and Daly, 2007)

A copy of the OpenTK library ships along as the engine uses it at the moment as a wrapper to OpenGL. 
Currently we're a bit low on documentation 
there are included a few X3D examples 
pulled from a few X3D content developers across the world wide web.
```

This engine has had a massive overhaul, now we support shader and script programming - we are working on implementing both the Interchange and Interactive profiles... Some important components such as Prototyping and Sensors are absent, right now there are a small number of issues on the backlog currently being investigated so stay tuned!

Notices
```

This is currently no full X3D framework .. Imao there is no X3D browser that currently supports the entire v3.3 spec 
However, this C# codebase is focusing on implementing the rendering component properly 
and nailing down X3D Core early so the project's foundations adhere to the spec more thoroughly longterm.

This project is the current source there is an earlier prototype of the project 
archived on Google Code from 3 years ago which was written using the classic OpenGL v2.0 API. 
All that was done in the original prototype has been replaced with a lighter more customisable OpenGL 4.0 compatible engine and GLSL shader code. 
This is why the project here on github serves as the current most up to date version, 
and will likely be better than other X3D browsers available today noted that I take my hat off to X3DOM.
There's experimental code released of which I try and keep as stable as I can for each commit, however no guarantees that the project is bug free. I am playing with lighting and prototyping - an area in the engine which is unstable at the moment. 
The latest source code may be checked out using " git clone https://github.com/RealityDaemon/x3d-finely-sharpened "
Use Visual Studio 2015 for development and compilation.
