# x3d-finely-sharpened
X3D browser/engine written in C#


Intro
```

With software like Blender as well as libraries like OpenTK, X3D as a markup for 3D scenes makes for a viable alternative to the COLLADA XML dialect and other 3D formats.

"X3D is used for building 3-dimensional models, both simple and sophisticated, X3D can show animated objects from different viewpoint perspectives, allowing user insight and interaction. X3D models can be further combined and connected to build sophisticated 3D virtual environments running across the Internet." (Brutzman and Daly, 2007)

A copy of the OpenTK library ships along as the engine uses it at the moment as a point of reference to OpenGL. Currently we're a bit low on documentation but I have included a few X3D examples pulled from random sources on the www.

Notices
```

This is currently no full X3D framework .. Imao there is no X3D browser that currently supports the entire v3.3 spec 
However, this C# codebase is focusing on implementing the rendering component properly 
and nailing down X3D Core early so the project's foundations adhere to the spec more thoroughly longterm.

This project is the current source there is an earlier prototype of the project 
archived on Google Code from 3 years ago which was written using the classic OpenGL v2.0 API. 
All that was done in the original prototype has been replaced with a lighter more customisable OpenGL 4.0 compatible engine and GLSL shader code. 
This is why the project here on github serves as the current most up to date version, 
and will likely be better than other X3D browsers available today noted that I take my hat off to X3DOM.
There's experimental code released of which I try and keep as stable as I can for each commit. 
The latest source code may be checked out using " git clone https://github.com/RealityDaemon/x3d-finely-sharpened "
Use Visual Studio 2015 for development and compilation.

```

Mission statement
```

A library implementing the X3D 3.3 specification, frugal by design, with no platform specific boundaries, 
and an X3D Scene that can be accessed/modified by whatever scripting language is present in the platform.
