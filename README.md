# x3d-finely-sharpened
X3D browser/engine written in C#


Intro
```

With software like Blender as well as libraries like OpenTK, X3D as a markup for 3D scenes makes for a viable alternative to the COLLADA XML dialect and other 3D formats.

"X3D is used for building 3-dimensional models, both simple and sophisticated, X3D can show animated objects from different viewpoint perspectives, allowing user insight and interaction. X3D models can be further combined and connected to build sophisticated 3D virtual environments running across the Internet." (Brutzman and Daly, 2007)

A copy of the OpenTK library ships along as the engine uses it at the moment as a point of reference to OpenGL. Currently we're a bit low on documentation but I have included a few X3D examples pulled from random sources on the www.
```



Example 1 - test of tessellated Sphere X3D node: X3D Runtime 3.3 Core using OpenGL Version 4

Notices
```

This is no full X3D framework .. Yet however in addition to a primary focus on C#, there is an experimental port to the dart language for the Web. The C# codebase is focusing on implementing rendering of basic FaceSet nodes and nailing down X3D Core early so the project's foundations adhere to the spec more thoroughly 

This project will remain here for archive purposes. I have nearly completed the rendering of and nodes according to specification There's experimental code released to address some of the items listed The latest source is in the repo `

```

Mission statement
```

A library implementing the X3D 3.3 specification, frugal by design, with no platform specific boundaries, and an X3D Scene that can be accessed/modified by whatever scripting language is present in the platform.
